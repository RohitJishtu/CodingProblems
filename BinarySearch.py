# 162. Find Peak Element
# Medium

# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.
# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
# Example 2:

# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.



# Start this from 2 sides 
# brute force 

# for first one we check only 1 

# Iterate through the array :
# prev=None . n-1 < len
# n , n-1 , prev 

# for the last one we check only 1 

nums1 =[1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output1= 5

nums2 = [1,2,3,1]
Output2= 2
